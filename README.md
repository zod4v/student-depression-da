Addressing a Critical Issue 🧠📊

Excited to share a deep dive into a topic that truly matters: student mental well-being. My latest project, the "Student Depression Data Analysis Project," leverages the power of data to shed light on key factors influencing student mental health.

Using MS SQL Server for robust data management and Tableau for compelling visualizations, I've analyzed student data across various dimensions, including:

☑️Academic Pressure
☑️Financial Stress
☑️Study Satisfaction
☑️Sleep Duration
☑️Study Hours

The dashboards and visuals created provide clear insights into student demographics in relation to these crucial areas. My hope is that this kind of data-driven understanding can contribute to more effective support systems for students.
